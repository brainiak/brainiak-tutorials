    "# Full Correlation Matrix Analysis\n",
    "[Contributions](#contributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The connectivity analyses we performed previously examined the coupling of different regions of the brain. This coupling can capture information that activity-based univariate or multivariate techniques do not detect. For instance, imagine that voxel A and B are coupled during one task condition and voxel A and C are coupled during another task condition. In such a case, voxel A may always be active (and thus task differences are likely to be invisible to activity-based approaches _including MVPA_), but its connectivity with other voxels will reveal task information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this creates a problem: to find these diagnostic voxels in an unbiased, data-driven fashion it is necessary to correlate every voxel in the brain with every other voxel and somehow analyze these millions or billions of pairwise correlations. This computation can take a very long time. Simplifying assumptions can be made to reduce the complexity of this analysis. For instance, it is possible to downsample the voxels (e.g., using parcellation as in the previous session) in order to reduce the total number of correlations that are made, but in doing so we introduce the assumption that those parcellations divide functional units of brain activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, advances in machine learning, parallel computing and efficient coding have made it possible to calculate and analyze billions of correlations rapidly. These tools are part of the [BrainIAK toolbox](http://brainiak.org/) and are used for Full Correlation Matrix Analysis (FCMA). This method is outlined in detail in [Wang et al. (2015)](http://ntblab.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Wang_JNM_2015.pdf). In what follows we will learn how to run FCMA and actually perform it on real data on a reasonable timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of FCMA is as follows: take every voxel in the brain and correlate it with every other voxel in the brain for each trial and participant. Then, take each big correlation matrix and turn it into a vector so that every pairwise relationship is represented as an element in that vector. This vector is a list of features that can be used for classification, just like we used voxels or principal components in past exercises. The vectors for each trial/condition can then be stacked so that we get an example by feature matrix. We can then feed that matrix into a classifier and determine whether the pattern of information across voxel pairs discriminates between conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use FCMA to determine if there exist brain regions, undetectable by MVPA, that show differential processing of attending to faces vs. scenes. We can compare our results from FCMA to the MVPA results that were generated in the searchlight notebook.\n",

In notebook-08 (seed-based connectivity) our epochs were the entire run of data but in the code here this is just each block of faces or scenes.

The epoch file is a list of participants/runs (here the same thing) in which each entry is a 3-D matrix of booleans, with the value =1 for all TRs for the epoch of interest and zero everywhere else. The dimensions of the 3-D matrix are condition (face or scene) by epoch (trial 1, 2, etc.) by TR. This means that for each condition and epoch, there is a vector of TR-length that represents whether any time points from this data ought to be included. \n",

    "To understand how voxel selection in FCMA works, remember what we did in a previous exercise on classifier optimization in which we learned different ways to perform cross-validation. When doing cross-validation, one option is to leave out some of your data such as a run or a participant while you fit parameters or select voxels. In FCMA, it is typical to perform nested cross-validation in which we leave out a participant for final testing on an outer loop (e.g., participant 18) and perform voxel selection with cross-validation on an inner loop with another participant left out to quantify feature selection performance (e.g., participant 17) and the rest used to conduct feature selection (e.g., participants 1-16). Thus, for each of 18 outer-loop folds, there are 17 inner-loop folds. To use this approach we simply ignore one subject's data before executing the voxel selection procedure (the inner loop itself). We can then use that data for final classifier testing. Then, on new iterations of the outer loop we can rotate which participants are to be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner loop voxel selection procedure consists of computing correlation matrices and the classification of correlation patterns. This is highly computationally demanding and has been optimized in BrainIAK, where the [VoxelSelector](http://brainiak.org/docs/brainiak.fcma.html?highlight=voxel%20selector#module-brainiak.fcma.voxelselector) method implements this massive computation (all voxels by all training subjects by all epochs). How does it work?\n",

    "3. Finally, it tests the classifier on the nth participant in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is repeated for `n` inner-loop folds of cross-validation and the accuracies are averaged across folds for each voxel. We can then rank voxels in terms of overall performance and use this ranking as a way to select which voxels have discriminative connectivity in the training set."

The controller process does the following: assigns a subset S of voxels to each of W workers; instructs the worker to compute the correlation between each of these voxels and the rest of the brain in each epoch; instructs the worker to analyze the correlation vectors for each voxel across epochs with MVPA and supplied condition labels; collects the analysis result (i.e., cross-validation accuracy) for each voxel and loads it into memory; and returns to the first step to assign another subset of voxels until there are none left.

Unlike there, where it was relatively easy to do feature selection (e.g., PCA), here the analyses are computationally and memory intensive and so we need to save intermediate steps.

We have created the script *fcma_classify.py* as a wrapper. This script is similar to the voxel selection script: data are loaded into memory on each processor, then normalized and prepared for input to FCMA, a *Classifier* object is made from the data and then fit. Like voxel selection, this can be called in a similar way to the classification tools from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",

    "In the above example, we have used a \"pre-computed\" kernel for the SVM classifier. If you would like to know more about the pre-computed kernel then read through this section, otherwise, feel free to move on to the next section. \n",
    " In BrainIAK, setting the kernel as \"pre-computed\" ensures that BrainIAK computes a kernel (the inner product of the correlation) and then passes it to to SVM for classification. This saves computational time. The mathematical details of using kernels can be found here: [kernels.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/kernels/0521813972c02_p25-46.pdf) Below, we outline the steps, for training and testing, that BrainIAK has used internally to optimize classification using a pre-computed kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$:The number of voxels in the top N mask. Computing correlations between all voxels will result in ${N}^2 $ features for each epoch that we need to classify.  \n",
    "$ x_i :$ Each training sample with N features. For e.g., for the first epoch, the features are: ${[x_{11}, x_{12},...,x_{1N}]}$   \n",
    "$num\\_train$: The number of training samples.     \n",
    "$num\\_test$: The number of testing samples.     \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute correlations for each voxel with every other voxel in the top N voxel mask. Each training sample x_i will have ${N}^2 $  features constituting all the correlation values between voxels. We make this a row matrix for each training sample.  \n",
    "Let's call this matrix $ \\mbox{ }Corr $. It is has dimensions $ [num\\_train \\mbox{ }X \\mbox{ } N^2] $ .  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In training, the goal is to build a linear classifier that will separate the training samples $ x_i $. This is equivalent to the problem of computing the weight vector as a linear combination of the training samples \n",
    "$$w = sum (\\alpha_i * x_i) $$(see [kernels](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/kernels/0521813972c02_p25-46.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we do this step?\n",
    "Transforming the problem into this linear combination of the training samples is referred to as the dual problem. It helps reduce the computational time. Notice, that the $\\alpha_i $ is written in terms of $G$, the inner product of the correlations of the training samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is $G$? It is the inner product: $Corr^T \\mbox{ } .Corr$.  \n",
    "The dimensions of $ Corr $ are $ [num\\_train \\mbox{ }X \\mbox{ } N^2]. $   \n",
    "Therefore, $G$ must have dimensions $[num\\_train \\mbox{ }X \\mbox{ } num\\_train].$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we now move away from $N^2$ dimensions of $Corr$   to $num\\_train^2 $ dimensions via *G*. We know that $num\\_train^2 $ is much smaller than $N^2$. This smaller space to work in makes things computationally efficient, and we find the same weights $w$.  This is why we solve the dual problem instead of working with $Corr$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\alpha_i $ are a function of $G$ and a loss parameter $\\lambda$. See eqn (2.6) in [kernels](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/kernels/0521813972c02_p25-46.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, *G* is the *precomputed* kernel. It is computed by taking the inner product of $Corr$ with itself. It is then passed to the `SVC.fit` method with the `pre-computed` flag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, SVC executes to find a good $\\alpha_i $ that will best fit the training data.  \n",
    "At this stage we have built a SVM model and **training is complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Testing**  \n",
    "Now we have a new sample $x_{new}$, and we have to predict its class.  \n",
    "The distance of this sample to the hyperplane is the inner product: $ <w, x_{new}> $.  \n",
    "In step #2 we wrote $w$ in terms of $\\alpha_i \\mbox{  } and \\mbox{  } x_i $, the training samples. We'll use that here.  \n",
    "The distance of $x_{new}$ to the hyperplane:  \n",
    "$ = \\mbox{  }  <w, x_{new}> \\mbox{  } = sum (\\alpha_i * <x_i, x_{new}>).$  \n",
    "\n",
    "We already know $\\alpha_i$, it's what the SVM has  fit from the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now simply compute the inner product for the new sample,  $ \\mbox{  }k= <x_i, x_{new}> $   \n",
    "Remember, the $x_i$ are just  the training samples. $i =1,2,..., num\\_train $  \n",
    "This $ k $ is the *precomputed* kernel for the $ x_{new} $ sample during testing.  \n",
    "The dimensions of $ k $, for one test sample is: $ [num\\_train \\mbox{ }X \\mbox{ } 1] $\n",
    "\n",
    "We pass $k$ to `SVC.predict` with the `pre-computed` flag and SVC will use the $ \\alpha_i $ and simply multiply out with $ k $ and sum it all up. This is the distance of the point $x_{new} $ from the hyperplane and it's class has been predicted.\n",
    "\n",

FCMA gives us an unbiased, data-driven, view of of the connectivity between voxels while subjects attend to faces and scenes. We had conjectured that MVPA will fail to highlight brain regions that show similar activity patterns to both conditions. A candidate brain region that might show similar activity patterns while attending to faces and scenes is the pre-frontal cortex. This is a region that changes it's selectivity based on the items attended ([Cukur et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603707)) and hence would be hard to decode across the two conditions in the face-scenes experiment.\n",
