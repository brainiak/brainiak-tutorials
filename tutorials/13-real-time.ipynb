    "# Real-Time fMRI Analysis\n",
    "[Contributions](#contributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical fMRI experiments the researcher creates a sequence of stimuli or events they want to show in advance and then measures the participant's brain activity in response to this pre-specified task. This provides an assessment of the relationship between behavior in the task and BOLD activity. However, although tempting, it is not possible to conclude from this correlation alone that active brain regions are causing the behavior. Such causal inferences have typically required directly intervening to disrupt or enhance the functioning of a brain region (e.g., via stimulation, lesioning, cooling, etc.) and then examining the impact on behavior. Such experimental manipulations of brain function, especially in a regionally specific way, require invasive techniques and so are not possible in healthy humans for ethical reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time fMRI is a step in the direction of (safely) manipulating brain regions, enabling more valid causal inferences about the brain and behavior. Specifically, rather than brain activity being just a dependent variable, it becomes part of the experimental design as a kind of independent variable. For more on real-time fMRI, see [here](https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858411407205) or [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.164).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance a recent study using real-time fMRI to train attention [deBettencourt et al. (2015)](http://ntblab.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/deBettencourt_NN_2015.pdf). In this study, patterns of brain activity were used to make the task easier or harder depending on the participant's attentional state, with the goal of training them to attend better. However, if the brain activity was too noisy or analyzed inappropriately, read out from brain regions that didn't contain information about attentional state, or taken from another participant's brain (as in the control condition), then the participant should not improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no second chances with real-time fMRI because your analysis is part of data collection. For example, you can't later decide to use a different preprocessing step, analysis algorithm, parameter setting, feedback type, etc. This is why preparation, piloting, and efficient code is critical for real-time fMRI. Think of it as mandatory pre-registration!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of real-time fMRI, but here we focus on using the multivariate methods from earlier notebooks to analyze data on the fly and generate feedback for participants in a closed-loop manner.\n",

Once transferred to the analysis computer, you will first need to read the DICOM data into a numpy array. The code below will then process the numpy array.

    "\n",
    "As each volume is received, it is necessary to preprocess it prior to analysis. Given the constraint of wanting to do this as close as possible to real-time, you will need to choose steps carefully and decide on the minimal set of steps that provide the most benefit. For example, motion correction, masking, and normalization might be sufficient. The simulator does not generate any motion artifacts so that step is unnecessary in this notebook. Masking is critical because we don't want to feed the model irrelevant features. Normalization in space (as we will do) is easy because each time point can be treated independently; however, normalizing across time is hard since each additional TR will change the mean and SD, and thus the z-values of all preceding TRs. This is a more general consequence of real-time, wherein you know the past but not the future. This also impacts temporal filtering, which must be done with \"causal\" filters. For this reason, procedures for normalizing and filtering over time are still being developed/refined.\n",

    "The goal of real-time fMRI is often to change brain function via neurofeedback. For instance, neural representations might change because the experiment trains participants to use different parts of their brain to process a stimulus. In such cases, a classifier trained at the start of the experiment will be wrong by the end of the experiment because the underlying feature space across voxels in the brain has changed. There are algorithms that can be used in these cases, which allow the model fit to be updated incrementally as new training examples come in. This can also be used to refine your model with more training data even if the underlying features are stable. \n",
