    "# Running Classifiers \n",
    "\n",
    "The spam folder did not exist on email systems in the recent past. Emails that were relevant to the reader had to be manually (and painfully) sorted from an array of emails soliciting money or selling hoax products, among other things. The classification of our emails, by machines, into relevant emails and spam, has advanced to such a degree that we now take for granted that all the spam email we receive is automatically routed to the spam folder, needing little oversight from us. These machine classifiers use algorithms that are applicable to a wide variety of fields: written language; spoken language (e.g. \"Hello Google\", \"Alexa\", \"Siri\"); navigating driverless cars; and we'll also use them to understand brain activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the steps of extracting fMRI signal, and then training and testing classifiers on the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of this script\n",
    "Using this script you will learn to use a classifier on a dataset. Specifically, we will accomplish the following:  \n",
    ">1. Assign labels to every time-point (TR) in the dataset.\n",
    ">2. Time-shift the signal to be classified, taking into consideration the delayed hemodynamic response.\n",
    ">3. Collect BOLD data for all runs into one array.\n",
    ">4. Test out a classifier (SVM) on a group of subjects with a fixed set of parameters.\n",
    ">5. Replicate the analysis that led to the modular vs. distributed processing debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite\n",
    "You should be familiar with the data loading and normalization steps in the 02-data-handling notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important terms you should be familiar with: TRs, labels.\n",

    "**Dataset** For this script we will use the localizer dataset from [Kim et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017) again. Just to recap: The localizer consisted of 3 runs with 5 blocks of each category (faces, scenes and objects) per run. Each block was presented for 15s. Within a block, a stimulus was presented every 1.5s (1 TR). Between blocks, there was 15s (10 TRs) of fixation. Each run was 310 TRs. In the MATLAB stimulus file, the first row codes for the stimulus category for each trial (1 = Faces, 2 = Scenes, 3 = Objects). The 3rd row contains the time (in seconds, relative to the start of the run) when the stimulus was presented for each trial. In this example, all the data have been pre-processed for you.\n",

If you have variables in your workspace (i.e., any variables you have created in the usage of jupyter) then they will usually be accessible/usable in a function, regardless of whether they are used as input parameters. However, any variables you create in a function cannot be used in your workspace if you don't return them as outputs. For this reason it is easier if you keep the names of the variables in your function separate from the names in your workspace. This is turtles all the way down: if you have a function within a function then variables will be shared in the same way.  \n",

    "The discovery of the Fusiform Face Area (FFA; Kanwisher, McDermott, and Chun, 1997; see also McCarthy, Puce, Gore, & Allison, 1997) was ground breaking for the field. The mean activity signal for face stimuli was larger than the mean for houses and objects. Thus, the FFA was preferential to faces, and by extension, it was inferred that all other cognitive processing must also be localized in brain regions yet to be discovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The local nature of processing was challenged by another study (Haxby et al., 2001). Instead of looking at the mean activity of a set of voxels, this study examined the _pattern of activity_ of a set of voxels. Thus, if the mean activity was similar for two conditions, but the pattern of activity across a set of voxels was different across the two conditions, we can discriminate between the two conditions. Using this technique, it was shown that faces are not represented just in the FFA alone, but are distributed across a variety of brain regions. This led to the distributed view of face processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will perform a decoding analysis in the FFA and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) using the VDC dataset. To recap, the FFA was shown as a face processing region and the PPA as a scene processing region. Specifically, you will analyze the patterns of activity in these ROIs in the following ways: \n",

Thus, the FFA would not just represent faces, but scenes and/or objects too. Also, scenes would not be exclusively represented in the PPA. \n",
