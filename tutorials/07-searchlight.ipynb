    "In univariate analyses there is a distinction between whole-brain and [ROI-based](https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsm006) analyses. When done correctly, whole-brain univariate analyses allow you to identify, in an unbiased and data-driven way, regions of the brain that differ between experimental conditions. Compare this to what we have done with multivariate classification: up to this point we have taken ROIs (e.g., FFA, PPA, even the whole brain) and looked at the pattern of activity across voxels. Using these procedures we have been able to determine whether these voxels collectively contain information about different conditions. However, throughout these analyses it has been unclear whether a subset of these voxels have been driving classification accuracy. Although we could use the weights to indicate which voxels are important, weights alone do not always convey the influence of individual voxels. In other words, we have been unable to say with certainty *where* in the brain there are representations that distinguish between conditions. \n",

    "A searchlight is a spatial moving window that exhaustively searches the brain in order to localize representations. Running a searchlight is computationally intensive because it involves running a separate multivariate analysis for every voxel in the brain. Imagine doing your feature selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and cross-validation 100,000 times or more. Fortunately, [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) contains a procedure that efficiently carves up brain data into appropriate chunks and distributes them across the computational resources available.\n",

    "## 1. Searchlight workflow <a id=\"sl_wf\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a searchlight is computationally intensive, complex and involves many steps. To show how the searchlight functionality in BrainIAK works, we will walk through the steps needed to perform a simple searchlight that can be run in this notebook before moving onto a real example that requires submitting the job to a cluster. This simple workflow takes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. [Data preparation](#data_prep)\n",
    ">2. [Set the searchlight parameters](#set_param)\n",
    ">3. [Create the searchlight object](#create_obj)\n",
    ">4. [Create our classification kernel](#create_kernel)\n",
    ">5. [Execute the searchlight](#exec_sl)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we start, there are a few things that you should know about searchlights. Think of a searchlight as a processing step in which you pull out a certain size chunk of your data and then perform a kernel operation (specified by a function you write). You can use any kernel on this chunk of data interchangeably. Critically, **the searchlight function does not specify the analysis you want to perform, all it does is carve up the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational demand and parallelization**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, searchlights are computationally intensive and so we need to be aware of what kind of burden they might impose. With each subject, we want to perform the operation thousands of times (once for each of their brain voxels). If we were to run this serially, even if each operation only took 1 s to complete, the analysis would take multiple days for only one participant. With nested cross-validation or other recursive steps, the full analysis could take months or years (and you'd lose a lot of points on your assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the searchlight function in [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) intelligently parallelizes your data to give you a considerable and scalable speed boost. Parallelization is the idea that when two or more computational tasks can be completed independently (because they don't interact in any way) then it is possible to run these tasks simultaneously on different cores. Note that we refer to cores as our unit of serial processing, although there are other parallelizations available within-core, such as threads or even multiple instructions within thread. The nice thing about parallelization is that it is scalable: in general, a job parallelized across 10 cores will run up to 10 times faster than on one core. For reference, your computer likely has 2, 4, or more cores, so you could speed up processing if you recruited all of these resources (and shut down all other types of background processing). \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "So remember, the two main things that determine the speed of a searchlight: the **kernel algorithm** and the **amount of parallelization**.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the BrainIAK searchlight work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze data efficiently, it is important to understand how the Searchlight function in [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) works. You must provide the function with a numpy volume of 4D data and a binary mask of brain voxels. The searchlight code simply searches for every voxel in the mask that is equal to 1 and then centers a searchlight around this. This means that for every value of 1 in your mask, the searchlight function will apply your kernel function to the corresponding voxel (and those around it) in the 4D volume. Hence when writing the kernel you need to keep in mind that the input data the function receives are not the size of the original data but instead the size of the searchlight radius. In other words, you might give the searchlight function a brain and mask volume that is 64x64x64 but each kernel operation only runs on a data and mask volume that is 3x3x3 (or whatever your searchlight radius is). As per the logic of searchlights, the center of each mask in the searchlight will be equal to 1 (otherwise the searchlight wouldn't have selected it). \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to start using a searchlight? Small!**\n",
    "\n",
    "When getting used to searchlights it is encouraged that you scale up your code gently. This is to prevent the possibility that you run a searchlight that takes a very long time to finish only to find there was a small error (which happens a lot). Instead it is better to write a simple function that runs quickly so you can check if your code works properly before scaling up. A simple workflow for testing your searchlight (and estimating how long your searchlight would take on a bigger dataset) would be this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a mask of one voxel and run the searchlight interactively (like we are doing now, using a notebook) to check whether the code works.\n",
    "2. Use timestamps to extract the execution time  \n",
    "3. Print the number of voxels that are passed to the searchlight function  \n",
    "4. Run the searchlight as a job on the smallest unit of real data you have (a single run or single participant)\n",
    "5. Check the runtime and memory usage of this searchlight (e.g. on slurm: `sacct -j $JID --format=jobid,maxvmsize,elapsed`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking our own advice, we are going to write a searchlight script below to perform a very simple searchlight. In fact we are only going to run this searchlight on one voxel in the brain so that we can see whether our code is working and how long each kernel operation would take. After we have familiarized ourselves with the way searchlights work on a small scale, we will then graduate to full-scale analyses using batch scripts and cluster computing."

A searchlight will be drawn around every voxel with the value of 1. Hence, if you chose to use the wholebrain mask as the mask for the searchlight procedure, the searchlight may include voxels outside of your mask when the \"center\" voxel is at the border of the mask. It is up to you to decide whether then to include these results.  \n",

For instance you might want the condition labels so that you can determine to which condition each 3D volume corresponds. If you don't need to broadcast anything, e.g, when doing RSA, set this to 'None'.  \n",

    "5. **max_blk_edge** = When the searchlight function carves the data up into chunks, it doesn't distribute only a single searchlight's worth of data. Instead, it creates a block of data, with the edge length specified by this variable, which determines the number of searchlights to run within a job.  \n",

When you submit a job, you are requesting use of part of the node, or sometimes even the entire node. **Optimizing the memory, and number of cores for your batch job will lead to significant gains in run-time for your programs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI handles all communication between the ranks (or processes). This can occur within a single node, or if you have asked for lots of resources, this can even span multiple nodes. Each process can spawn multiple threads, and Open-MP handles communication between threads.\n",

Once your analysis has finished (should take ~6 mins), load in your averaged searchlight results and plot it with the imported function [plotting](http://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.plotting) from nilearn. You will find function [plotting.plot_stat_map](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.plotting.plot_stat_map.html) useful. However, be aware that some of these functions assume the brain is MNI space. This face-scene dataset is not in MNI space, so if you overlay it on the default background the image will be 'outside of the brain'. To visualize this correctly, also provide the image as `bg_img` into this function. Also load in the averaged searchlight results across all 18 subjects we computed for you and plot it. The file is in the same directory as this notebook, called 'avg18_whole_brain_SL.nii.gz'. Use the same 'cut_coords', 'threshold', and 'vmax' across these two plots. You can start from threshold=0.65, cut_coords=(50,-40,10), vmax=1 for a good visualization. Compare the two plots. "
