    "# Shared Response Modeling\n",
    "[Contributions](#contributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is reliable across different participants when performing the same task, for example watching a movie? In previous notebooks, inter-subject correlation and inter-subject functional correlation revealed similarity in patterns of brain activity across participants. We can exploit this similarity to find a lower-dimensional shared space that retains features of the data that are common across participants. The shared response model (SRM) aims to learn this shared feature space and how to map individual participant data into it ([Chen et al., 2015](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5855-a-reduced-dimension-fmri-shared-response-model)). SRM can be used as a functional alignment technique: once fit, other data from the same participants can be transformed into the shared space with these mappings, to be used as input for other analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SRM, the brain data for each participant $i$ are represented as an $n$ voxel by $t$ time matrix $X_i$. A pre-specified number of features are used to learn a $k$ feature by $t$ time shared space $S$ and a participant-specific $n$ voxel by $k$ feature matrix $W_i$. This weight matrix, reflecting the loading of voxels onto features, is randomly initialized then fit over iterations to minimize the error in explaining participant data. At the same time, the time course of the features in the shared space is learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "SRM can be summarized graphically as follows (from [Cohen et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4499)):![image](https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-assets/neuro/journal/v20/n3/images/nn.4499-F4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "SRM requires that each participant is exposed to the same sequence of stimulus events. For this reason, continuous movies or stories are often used, although datasets (e.g., block-design localizers) where the trials are in the same order across participants have also been used with SRM. If counterbalancing was used between participants, it is technically possible to still perform SRM by rearranging the data, although mileage may vary. For best results, the epochs that are counterbalanced ought to be long (e.g., >30s). It is also important to note that SRM needs a lot of training data, up to 400 TRs or more for stable performance.\n",

For these same participants and voxels, the dataset also includes eight runs where participants viewed images from seven categories. Each TR was 3s long and the movie was 2203 TRs long in total. Because the data have already been pre-processed and turned into a numpy file, we don't need to load them with nibabel tools.\n",

It includes 18 subjects who listened to a real-life story lasting seven minutes (intact condition).

    "### 1.2 Example: Shared Lasagne Making<a id=\"SRM_logic\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be difficult to understand the logic of SRM. One way of explaining it that we have found useful is by way of a quirky analogy to making a lasagne.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you and I both know how to make lasagne. These lasagnes are comprised of many components, such as the tomato sauce, pasta texture, cheese sauce, etc., which are like our **voxels** in brain data. Lasagnes are layered and we could sample these layers individually, especially as we are making the lasagne, and evaluate the two lasagne on all of these components. Hence, each layer could be thought of like a **time-point** in brain data and for each layer we could compare how similar our two lasagnes are across each of the components used to make the lasagne.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hear your lasagne is better than mine so I want to make it more like you do. You are very protective of your recipe but you are willing to let me sample the layers of your lasagne. This means that I can compare my lasagne with yours. After tasting the first half of your lasagne (the **training data**), I realize that yours is better because yours is more salty than mine (always salt your food!). In other words, I learnt an abstract **feature** — salt — that none of my original dimensions captured by sampling your training data — the first few layers. This feature may be more important (i.e., have a high **weight**) for some components of the lasagne than others, for instance the importance of adding salt to the pasta is more than adding salt to the cheese sauce. Hence for each of the components I have a way of adding or removing salt to make it taste more like yours. This allows me to **transform** the first few layers of my lasagne to be more like yours by changing the way I use salt. Critically, the way I salt the different components of the lasagne is not layer specific: what I learnt is a way to change my default setting of salt to better match yours and it is applied to all layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protect your prized recipe, you decide to cut me off from tasting your lasagne, meaning I have finished **fitting** my notion (**model**) of how to make my lasagne taste like yours. At this point, I know that if I change how I salt the first few layers then I can make my lasagne better resemble your lasagne. However, because I never tasted the last few layers of your lasagne, I don't have any way of knowing whether that same transformation should be applied to those to make it taste like yours. Hence, these last few layers can be **testing data** to see if using the same salting procedure (i.e., those same weights) makes my lasagne similar to yours. The final test would then be to check whether these last few layers are similar to yours in order to determine whether that salting procedure worked on **out-of-sample** data that was not used for training that transformation.\n"

    "### 1.3 Splitting data into training and test  <a id=\"split\"></a>\n",

The training data is used to train the model (i.e., to find the transformation from voxel space into feature space) and the test data is used for evaluating the model. In this case we are going to split each participant's movie viewing data down the middle, using the first half for training and the second half for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a dataset is continuous like this we will often use one half for training and the other half for testing in one fold, reverse the training and test sets in a second fold, and then average the results across both folds. This is not possible with all datasets though, such as when the test is run on a qualitatively different type of task."

    "## 5. Time-segment matching<a id=\"time_seg\"></a>\n",
    "One of the tests that has been used to quantify the benefits of SRM is *time-segment matching*. This test involves taking an isolated, unknown segment of fMRI data from a held-out subject and trying to determine *when in the movie* the segment occurred, by comparing the segment to the whole fMRI time series acquired from other subjects. If you have a 30s \"mystery\" segment of data from a held-out subject, you could compare it to all 30s segments of group data from the whole movie and see which one has the highest neural similarity. For example, if the mystery segment matches best to the segment taken from 1:00 to 1:30 of the movie and that is actual time period during which the mystery segment of fMRI data was acquired, the match would be correct.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The full process is shown in the figure below. The left part shows how to learn W and test on the held-out subject. Their data are transformed into the shared space by fixing $S$ and learning a mapping $W_m$ into this space. That is, the test subject does not impact the fitting of the shared responses but their data can still be projected into this space. The right part shows the algorithm used to determine the best-matching segment (here, a max-correlation classifier). Note that the classifier computes the match to the correct segment and all segments that do not overlap in time with the correct segment. Segments that overlap with the correct segment are excluded on the grounds that it would be difficult to distinguish segments that closely overlap in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./imgs/lab11/srm_time_segment_matching.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind time-segment matching is that, if the fMRI time series are well-aligned across participants and different parts of the movie have unique fMRI signatures, it should be possible to identify the mystery segment by comparing that segment to properly-timestamped fMRI time series from other participants. One might expect SRM to boost time-segment-matching accuracy, compared to anatomically aligned voxel space, by increasing the consistency of neural patterns across subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sequence of steps is used to perform time-segment matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Create a sliding window of size `win_size`.\n",
    "> - Break time series into `nseg` overlapping windows. \n",
    "> - Extract data for each of these segments.\n",
    "> - One subject is taken out for leave-one-subject-out testing. Note the input data contain all subjects. The removal of one subject from a list for cross-validation is similar to what we covered in previous notebooks (e.g., [FCMA](https://brainiak.org/tutorials/09-fcma/)).\n",
    "> - A correlation is computed between the segments in the held-out subject and the segments from the average of the other subjects (similar ISC). The `compute_correlation` function in BrainIAK is used to calculate this.  \n",
    "> - For each segment in the held-out subject, the segment from the average of others with the maximum correlation value is found.  \n",
    "> - If the maximum correlation corresponds to the same time period in the test and training data, we score that as an accurate classification.  \n",
