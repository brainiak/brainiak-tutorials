    "The functional connectivity methods that we used in previous notebooks compared time series of BOLD activity between voxels within participant to infer how different regions of the brain were interacting. However, BOLD activity contains multiple components ([Figure a](#fig1)):\n",
    "1. Task-based/stimulus-evoked signal that is reliable across participants\n",
    "2. Intrinsic fluctuations in neural activity that are participant specific\n",
    "3. Scanner or physiological noise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider methods that combine data across participants to eliminate #2 and #3 when calculating fMRI reliability (intersubject correlation, ISC, [Hasson et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1089506)) and connectivity (intersubject functional correlation, ISFC, [Simony et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12141)). ISC and ISFC help isolate #1 because it is the only component that ought to be shared across participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure b,c](#fig1) show how ISC differs from functional connectivity: rather than correlating brain regions, which preserves participant-specific activity and noise, ISC correlates between the brains of different participants in order to capture only the activity that is shared. In ISC, this correlation is done for every voxel in the brain to the matching voxel in other brains, producing a full brain map. [Figure e](#fig1) shows this as the diagonal of a correlation matrix, where each cell corresponds to a voxel in subject X correlated with the same anatomical voxel in subject Y. In practice, to simplify the computation and the interpretation it is typical for ISC to compare each individual participant with the average of all other participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure d](#fig1) shows ISFC: the correlation of every voxel in one participant with every other voxel in another participant (or average of other participants). This is like FCMA except it is between participants rather than within participants. In fact, these analyses use the same computational tricks. ISFC is valuable because it allows us to identify activity coupling in voxels that are not aligned across participants: the off diagonal in [Figure e](#fig1) represents correlations for voxels in different parts of the brain.\n",

    "We will use ISC and ISFC to identify brain regions that respond preferentially to narrative stories, rather than to a random assortment of words (replicating Simony et al., 2016). Furthermore, seed-based connectivity analysis does not show differences between resting state, random words, and intact narratives, but ISFC does distinguish between these conditions (Simony et al., 2016). Thus, ISFC shows greater sensitivity to the task than seed-based functional connectivity. \n",

    ">18 native English speakers were scanned (15 females, ages: 18–31), corresponding to the replication dataset from the Pieman study.  \n",
    ">Stimuli for the experiment were generated from a 7 min real life story ([\"Pie Man\", Jim O'Grady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nZzSUDECLo)) recorded at a live storytelling performance ([\"The Moth\" storytelling event](https://themoth.org/), New York City). Subjects listened to the story from beginning to end (intact condition).\n",
    ">In addition, subjects listened to scrambled versions of the story, which were generated by dividing the original stimulus into segments of different timescales (paragraphs and words) and then permuting the order of these segments. To generate the scrambled stimuli, the story was segmented manually by identifying the end points of each word and paragraph. Two adjacent short words were assigned to a single segment in cases where we could not separate them. Following segmentation, the intact story was scrambled at two timescales: short—‘words’ (W; 608 words, 0.7±0.5 s each) and long—‘paragraphs’ (P; 11 paragraphs, 38.1±17.6 s each). Laughter and applause were classified as single word events (4.4% of the words). Twelve seconds of neutral music and 3 s of silence preceded, and 15 s of silence followed, each playback in all conditions. These music and silence periods were discarded from all analyses.\n",

    "We can apply the idea of inter-subject analysis to RSA. So far, ISC is being computed between aligned pairs of voxels across time points and it is commonly referred to as temporal ISC. However, we could instead correlate between aligned pairs of time points across voxels. That is, how does the pattern of activity across voxels for one time point correlate with the average pattern of the other participants at that time point. By doing this for each time point, we can generate a time course of these correlations to observe the general ebb and flow of coupling in brain activity across participants. This can be done simply by transposing the voxel and time dimensions (for a 3-D matrix, this is accomplished with a 90 degree rotation). This is a simple [transposition](https://lihan.me/2018/01/numpy-reshape-and-transpose/). If we have data in the format: (TRs, voxels, subjects), we can use `data.transpose(1,0,2)`, where the indices refer to the dimensions of the array and we will have an array in the format (voxels, TRs, subjects)."
